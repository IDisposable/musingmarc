My last post was 18 months ago... I deleted the two that followed it because they were time-sensitive. I've been sucked into twitter, StackOverflow, parenthood and real life. Coming soon, I hope, will be a bunch of posts on some C# hacks and T-SQL things I've been up to... mostly ASP.Net and twitter related (e.g. huge datasets)

Parenthood must have sucked a lot more out of you than Stack Overflow, 'cuz I've been on SO about the same length of time you've been, but my Rep is about 3X yours! :-)

Hey Marc  
  
I found you on Twitter and followed the link to your site. I am a publisher analyst at EnticeLabs. We do online recruitment advertising. We represent some really great clientele, many of which are Fortune 500 companies. Right now we are looking to find qualified software engineers and programmers. I want to talk to you about the possibilities of having you tweet these jobs to your followers. They are great jobs from great companies, not only will it look great for you but it will be beneficial to your followers as well.  
  
  
Regards,
