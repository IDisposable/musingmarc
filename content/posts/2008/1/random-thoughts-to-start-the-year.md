1.  The Blues deserve a good bounce. I just finished watching the Blues v. Stars game and there's no question that they outplayed the Stars all but the first couple minutes. That crappy bounce off Tkachuk's skate beat us. That's all.
2.  Xen's bout with RSV teaches a couple lessons. First, no matter how hard the nights are, you will miss your boy's loud cry when it is replaced by a weak wail of despair. My soul can't handle that kind of trial very often and I thank God that he knows what I can bear. It's simple, when you can't do anything to help, you feel useless... when everything you do (sucking his nose clear, pounding the phlegm out of his lungs) actually make your child cry more, it's HARD. Second, there are things that make you remember where you are in life... I'm a senior developer, the old-wise-guy at church, and a BABY as a dad. I don't know squat.
3.  When you need something that isn't .Net all the way, expect it to be hard. In this case, Subversion to Team Foundation tools SUCK. And the Subversion paradigm expects you to Alt.Net it and NOT use TFS, even though it is several dozen times better a tool.Â  Expect me to be announcing something based on the TFS Migration Toolkit soon, cause damn sure Microsoft isn't going to bother.
4.  Be VERY careful what skills you teach your children. No matter if they are good, or bad, they will be used against you.  
    The other day, at a Blues home game; my 4 year old daughter, Arianna, was squirming a bit in the seat. I told her that if she didn't stop I was going to turn her into a goon. The next whistle (she's a GOOD hockey fan) she asks, "Dad, are fairies real?".  
    My spidey sense being dull, I answered, "No, they're just like Santa Claus, just a character."  
    She replies with **no** delay, "Then you can't turn me into a goon."
