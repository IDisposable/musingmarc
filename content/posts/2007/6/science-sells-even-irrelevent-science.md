Recent research shows that including a scientific _explanation_ of psychological phenomena increases people's acceptance of the explanation. This holds true even when the "science" is irrelevant. I suspect this extends to other explanations in other areas. Would you be more likely to accept a web-standard when backed with lots of numbers that you don't really (take time to) understand?
