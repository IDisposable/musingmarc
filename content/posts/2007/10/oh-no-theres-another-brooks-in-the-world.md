I am happy to announce the birth of Xavier Eli Brooks at 1322 of October 4th.

After faking us out by turning himself around the night before the inversion, he resumed his (dad mirroring) ways and refused to turn the crown fully upside down. After 12 hours of Cervidil and 18 hours of contractions standing on his ear, he wasn't coming any closer to finding the stage door so we opened a new one just to his right.

He emerged warping space-time at a mass of 7 pounds 6 ounces, and a length of 19 3/4 inches, not that those numbers actually tell you anything about him.

Beth and baby are both fine, thanks for asking.
