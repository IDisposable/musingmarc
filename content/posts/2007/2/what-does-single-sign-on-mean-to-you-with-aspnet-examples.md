While looking for sample code for simply cross-domain single sign-on for a new project, I stumbled across [Micheal Morozov's](http://blogs.neudesic.com/blogs/michael_morozov/default.aspx) excellent detailing of six different common meanings when someone talks about single sign-on. Better yet, he details the way that you setup ASP.Net web.config and code to accomplish each. Read [Single signon for everyone](http://blogs.neudesic.com/blogs/michael_morozov/archive/2006/03/17/72.aspx) for the details.
