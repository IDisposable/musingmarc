Who out have expected [**this** outcome](http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/story/A7A2FBDF17709E0F8625728100051BB2?OpenDocument)?

Amazing, really, that parents that struggle through the convoluted course of modern adoptions seem to care for thier children more than biological parents. I'm **so** they've spent the time and money necessary to confirm what my 3 year old would say "Duh!" about.

I'm an adoptive parent, so I can attest to that. There's no way anyone would put up with the crap they made us go through unless they really really wanted kids -- and planned to invest their whole selfs in them.
