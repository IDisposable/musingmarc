The fine folks at [Attrice](http://www.attrice.info/) have just released [version 1.3 of the Team Foundation Sidekicks](http://www.attrice.info/downloads/index.htm). This time, they have added something very near and dear to my heart -- the "Shelveset Sidekick". If you've ever struggled with the odd UI inside Visual Studio for the various shelveset functionality or you can't understand why things are buried like they are... this new release is for you.
