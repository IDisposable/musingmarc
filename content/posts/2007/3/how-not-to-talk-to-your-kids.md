*   Don't tell them they are smart... tell them they worked hard.
*   Don't praise them for being good at something... tell them they are getting better through practice.
*   Don't tell them they are bad at something... tell them how to do it right.

I see a TON of me in [this tremendous article](http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/index.html). I recognise how my hesitency NOW in my professional life is directly related to how I think internally that it _should be easy for me_, so when it isn't something feels wrong.
