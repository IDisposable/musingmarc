I'm in...

*   #### Say _Everything_ As If Speaking To _Everyone_
    
    (because you are)
    
*   #### If You _Must_ Be A _Jerk_, Don't Be An _Anonymous_ One
    
    (because that's cowardly)
*   #### _Encourage_ Others To _Abide_ By This Code
    
    (because it's neighborly, plus recursive rules are fun)
*   #### When _Others_ Don't Care To Abide, **_Ignore Them_**
    
    (because they're not worthy of your time)
