It seems there are several not-very-overlapping audiences for this blog. There are people reading for the [SQL](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/search/label/SQL) stuff, especially the [datetime](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/search/label/DateTime) related stuff. There are people reading for the [Lightweight Code Generation](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/search/label/lightweight%20code%20generation) stuff, especially the [DynamicMethod/DynamicSorter](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/search/label/DynamicMethod) library. Then there are the people hunting down information about the [RSSToolkit](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/search/label/RssToolkit) library. Finally, there's the people following the recent [URITemplate](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/search/label/UriTemplate) library.

Since many of you visitors seem to have specific interestes, I've added the ability to subscribe to individual labels applied to the posts via the excellent tip given by Daniel Cazzulino in his [instructional posting](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DanielCazzulino/~3/185857822/41836.aspx "Blogger: how to provide label/tag feeds").

Just check out the labels listing on the right-side navigation. Oh, if you only read via a feed, this _might_ be worth a read of the actual page.
