A [javascript client-side implementation](http://code.google.com/p/repetitionmodel/) of the [WHATWG](http://www.whatwg.org/) [Web Forms 2.0](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/) [repetition model](http://whatwg.org/specs/web-forms/current-work/#repeatingFormControls).

Awesomely cool.
