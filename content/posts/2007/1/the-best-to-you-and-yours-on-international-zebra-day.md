Once again this year, I wish you all a wonderous and happy International Zebra Day

Every year January 31st, since 1978, I and many like me _okay, maybe not like **me**_ [have celebrated](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2005/01/happy-international-zebra-day.html) the joys of God's greatest creation, the humble zebra. Join with us this year:

1.  Eat a "zebra" ice cream (twisted vanilla and chocolate [soft-serve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_ice_cream))
2.  Get [arrested](http://www.pww.org/article/view/4786/1/202/) in Phoenix
3.  Hug a [referee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee)
4.  Watch an old movie (you know, no color, or just ["Stripes"](#Stripes)\[0\])
5.  Legally [cross the street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Crossing)
6.  Buy a [finch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Finch)
7.  Grow a [tomato](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tomato_cultivars)
8.  Most important of all, [go to the zoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_Zoological_Park) and visit with a Zebra

To answer the most obvious question, because there's nothing else going on at the end of January, of course!
