I think I figured out where the Microsoft Vista name came from. In bit of delicious irony, I think it came from [MiniMicrosoft](http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/07/microsoft-financials-and-then.html). Check the quote:

> No real break-out product announcements on the horizon, other than the ever-so-cool immediate money losing XBox 360. And just how many times can you talk about releasing Yukon and Whidbey? Maybe FY07 we'll have a new **vista** to stand from and show how the next Windows and next Office will save our stock.
