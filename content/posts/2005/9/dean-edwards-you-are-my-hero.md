While looking for yet another CSS hack-fix for IE, I stumbled upon a really sweet site. Dead Edwards has built **two** really nice tools (and more). First there is his [IE7 Compatibility](http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/) fixes library, which basically makes all recent versions of IE (before 7) not have the commonly CSS layout bugs. This is cool. The other package is [cssQuery](http://dean.edwards.name/my/cssQuery/), which adds the ability to select DOM elements using the CSS selectors in both CSS1 and CSS2 syntax. Who needs `getElementsByTagName` now?
