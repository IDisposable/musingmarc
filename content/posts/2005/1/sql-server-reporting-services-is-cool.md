If you haven't played with [it](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/reporting/default.asp) yet, install Microsoft SQL Server 2000, then [install](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/reporting/howtobuy/default.asp#existing) Reporting Services. Now, I know you might be saying _"Why would I want to get dependant on yet another obtuse Microsoft product?"_ The answer is five-fold: 1) It is a [very good](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/reporting/productinfo/SQL_Reporting.swf) tool 2) It is [free](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/reporting/howtobuy/faq.asp) with SQL Server 2000 3) The report specification is [open](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/reporting/techinfo/rdlspec.asp) XML 4) There are [open source](http://www.fyireporting.com/) implementations 5) There **is** [information](http://www.codeproject.com/books/MSReportingServices.asp) about it out there I learn something new [every day](http://www.codeproject.com/info/latest.asp) from Code Project
