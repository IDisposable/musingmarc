Microsoft has made another huge donation to the best-practices code base. I've just finished giving the code a once-over and I'm very pleased indeed. They've tighted things up on all the old application blocks they previously shipped. The application blocks that comprise the Enterprise Library are the following:

* [Caching Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/caching1.asp). This application block allows developers to incorporate a local cache in their applications.
* [Configuration Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/config.asp). This application block allows applications to read and write configuration information.
* [Data Access Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/daab.asp). This application block allows developers to incorporate standard database functionality in their applications.
* [Cryptography Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/crypto1.asp). This application block allows developers to include encryption and hashing functionality in their applications.
* [Exception Handling Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/ehab.asp). This application block allows developers and policy makers to create a consistent strategy for processing exceptions that occur throughout the architectural layers of enterprise applications.
* [Logging and Instrumentation Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/logging.asp). This application block allows developers to incorporate standard logging and instrumentation functionality in their applications.
* [Security Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnpag2/html/security1.asp). This application block allows developers to incorporate security functionality in their applications. Applications can use the application block in a variety of situations, such as authenticating and authorizing users against a database, retrieving role and profile information, and caching user profile information.

My recommendation is to download this code and learn to use it, the code is solid and the documentation is much improved.
