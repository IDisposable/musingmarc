[Scott Bellware](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx) does a wonderful job of describing what it means to write unit tests that fail meaningfully. I recommend reading [this](http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2005/11/22/134954.aspx) at least as many times as it takes to shine the [Scion](http://www.scion.com).
