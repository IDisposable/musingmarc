Catching up on a newly subscribed blog for Derrick Coetzee, I came across a great post about [Bloom Filters](http://blogs.msdn.com/devdev/archive/2005/08/17/452827.aspx). I immediately recognized that use from the Borland Turbo Lightning product that I used in the mid to late 80s. It was an awesome [TSR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminate_and_Stay_Resident) that loaded and then spell-checked whatever text proceeded the cursor at every space (or other work separator). A simple "beep" told you something was suspicious and a hot-key would popup the suggestions. It worked by scraping the screen RAM (in text mode, of course) and thus worked in EVERYTHING. I wonder if such a tool is available for Windows? Of course, I had to let Derrick know and that meant looking up the information and that's when the fun **really** started? Dig this quote from the April 1986 [article](http://www.byte.com/art/9604/sec5/art2.htm) from Jerry Pournelle

> In the word-processing category, there's a three-way tie and an honorable mention. Tied for best of 1985 are Symantec's Q&A, Borland's Turbo Lightning, and Living Videotext's Ready! idea processor. It's impossible to choose among these; they're all useful. Two are memory-resident. I suppose that one day the trend to memory-resident software will be halted by a really excellent multitasking operating system. Maybe this year?

Ah, the good old days...
