Looks like Rio is [dead](http://www.dm-holdings.com/eng/media/press/2005/20050826.html). Now I don't know what to do... my current Karma needs a minor power-switch repair (which I'm doing this weekend), and the Circuit City extended warranty expires in March. I was hoping to see the new Karma replacement hit the stores before then, but since D&M sold off all the IP and engineers to Sigmatel, that wasn't likely. Now with Rio shuttering, it's certainly not going to happen. So, sometime before March, I need to find a good HDD DAP that Circuit City carries (or sell the gift card). I'm on the lookout for a good 30GB+ music player (video and stuff is not a feature), with USB host mode or an SD slot (to get stuff off my camera). ID3 tag based navigation and **_gapless_**. Any ideas?
