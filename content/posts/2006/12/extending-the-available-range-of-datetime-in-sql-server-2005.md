Since I get so many hits for my [various](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2006/07/more-on-dates-and-sql.html "More on DATEs and SQL") [SQL DateTime](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2006/07/need-date-range-in-sql-without-filling.htmlhttp://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2006/07/need-date-range-in-sql-without-filling.html "Need a date range in SQL without filling a  table?") [articles](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2006/02/sql-date-processing-firstlast-day-of.html "SQL Date processing - First/Last Day of a month"), I thought I would point out an **awesome** contribution by [Mladen Prajdic](http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/ "Blogging about SQL Server and .Net") on building a [UDT for SQL Server 2005](http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/mladenp/archive/2006/12/16/52754.aspx) in CLR that gives you all that standard SQL Server DateTime behavior over the full range of the .Net DateTime class (01-01-0001 - 12-31-9999).

Nice work, Mladen!

I value the input of my readers as far as the content, however the colors and such of my blog are my choices and reflect how my machine normally appears. I find the bog-standard black-text on white-background exceedingly bright and irritating.  
  
I am sorry that you find the blog hard to read, perhaps you should apply your own stylesheets to the page or simply disable the CSS in your browser.  
  
Also, "pl" is not an English word, "please" is likely what you mean...
