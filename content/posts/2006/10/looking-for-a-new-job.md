I keep hearing that nobody can find a decent developers. Of course finding decent jobs can be a bit tough, but now the fine guys at [The Daily WTF](http://thedailywtf.com/ "Morons exposed every day.") have come up with a great way to syndicate job listings through blogs to directly target the kind of people that might be interested (based on the fact that you are reading my blog).

I've signed up, and any commissions I receive will be donated to [Project Gutenburg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page "Making the world's books available online for free"). So, if you know anyone that wants to [list a job, point them here](http://pubs.hiddennetwork.com/1046/post.aspx "Post your job listing"), and if you are looking for a job, check my blog side-bar or footer, or [browse the listings here](http://pubs.hiddennetwork.com/1046/browse.aspx "Cool jobs").
