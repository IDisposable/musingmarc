> For getting up and running this is pretty true. However, there are [ongoing wars](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2006/02/20/138778.aspx) between the RAD (everything’s declarative) camp and the non RADs. Just hope you don’t get caught between the two when trying to figure out a good solution to a particular problem.

This really resounds with me today. I've been using [ASP.Net 2.0](http://www.asp.net), [Atlas](http://atlas.asp.net/), [Atlas Control Toolkit](http://atlas.asp.net/atlastoolkit/), the [CSS Controls Adapters](http://www.asp.net/cssadapters/) and they just don't all hang together well. The message is confused too, we've got open-source on ACT and CSSCA (yeah!), but not on Atlas or the Atlas Extenders (boo!). Don't even get me started about the confusion between WPF, Click-Once or "traditional" ASP.Net.

No wonder we're all out here still creating the same set of applications (CRM, CMS, Order Entry, Portals, Aggregators, Forums, etc.) over and over instead of building something new.
