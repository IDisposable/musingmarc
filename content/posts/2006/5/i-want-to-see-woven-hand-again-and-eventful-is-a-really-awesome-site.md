I was looking into the client-side aggregation features of [_eventsites_](http://www.eventsites.co.uk/ "Event Sites"). Unfortunately, _eventsites_ requires FireFox, so I couldn't really play much. I did, however, look into the architecture described in [this](http://www.webkitchen.co.uk/2006/05/eventsites-serverless-web-development.html) [pair](http://www.webkitchen.co.uk/2006/05/eventsites-architecture.html) of articles by [webkitchen](http://www.webkitchen.co.uk/). This clever application uses [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/ "The best of the interactive maps") for the event location mapping [API](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/), uses [Flickr](http://flickr.com/ "Online photos to share") for photos from the event. It uses [evdb.com](http://evdb.com "Events Database") as the background event distributed-database. I actually like the [eventful.com](http://eventful.com "Search Local Events Worldwide") site that exposes this database. It is really easy to use and packed with features. I added some venues in my home town, added a couple events and performers and even created some "demands" for shows from bands I really like. Those demand can be exposed on your own site for others to click on and "increase the demand". I like this idea a lot. Maybe [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com "Microsoft's home site.") could use this setup for polling the development community for features we want, instead of [this](http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/default.aspx "MSDN Product Feedback Center") monstrosity.

Anyway, here's my demands for **Woven Hand** and **Over The Rhine** showing a couple of styles available. The nicest thing is the way this whole site works to make life easy both for users AND for developers using the [API](http://api.evdb.com/ "EVDB's API") exposed at evdb.com.
