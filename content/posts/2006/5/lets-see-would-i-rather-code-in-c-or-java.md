Me, I like C# a lot more. But that cool [new tool](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) from Google that lets me code in Java and it runs as JavsScript on the client browser intrigues me.

But, **just in time** [Nikhil Kothari](http://www.nikhilk.net/) saves the day!

How about a C#-to-Javascript compiler that is hooked into the Atlas library. Check out the [Script# Prototype](http://www.nikhilk.net/Entry.aspx?id=121)
