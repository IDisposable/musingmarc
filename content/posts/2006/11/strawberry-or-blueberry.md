With elections one day away (finally!), I was actually brought to tears of laughter by [this lovely Ze Frank episode](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/11/110206.html "endorse your fruit").

Me, I have grown to  hate both [blueberries](http://www.democrats.org/) and [strawberries](http://www.gop.org/), though [one of the strawberries](http://talent.senate.gov/ "Does what he says he stands for... I respect that.") seems to be pretty good... of course he's fighting a [real peach](http://www.claireonline.com/ "Lazy, lying, and corrupt...") of a blueberry, who I would rather see unemployed than doing the crappy job so far...

Speaking of which, if you want a real auditor, wouldn't it make sense to pick an accountant that isn't a strawberry or blueberry? Maybe we should look a little deeper for some unique flavor.

I think I'm going off the board for a bit of [Buddha's Hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha%27s_hand "The oddest citrus you'll ever see.") and vote for [Terry Bunker for Missouri state auditor](http://www.bunkerforauditor.com/ "Indepent is good...").

Of course, that's just my opinion, feel free to think for yourselves...
