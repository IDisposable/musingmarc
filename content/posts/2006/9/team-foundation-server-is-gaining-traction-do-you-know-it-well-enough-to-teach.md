I'm very pleased with my experiences thus far with Team Foundation. It's version control tools are excellent, the work item stuff is very flexible, but in truth I haven't worked with much of the rest of it. There's all the portal stuff, the guidance stuff, the diagramming tools. All very cool, but not quite on my radar.

So today, when I got a call from a recruiter looking for someone to mentor a team in the effective use of TFS, I **knew** I wasn't the guy for the job... not to mention that I'm happy doing what I'm doing, and I'm not interested in relocating out of St. Louis for anyone.

What I want to know is if anyone out there is interesting in a 6 month mentoring gig in Harlesville, PA mentoring 20-25 people in the effective use of TFS feel free to contact me or [Lynne Trottnow](mailto:LTrottnow@starpoint.com) for more information.

To the Microsoft TFS team, I say "job well done!".
