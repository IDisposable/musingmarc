Countless security holes go weeks without being addressed, I've had many .Net bug reports closed with _Won't-Fix_ due to "time constraints" before the nearly-year-long-coming service pack, yet a DRM flaw gets patched in 3 days. Does anyone REALLY think that Microsoft's priorities are remotely related to what is good for the **customer**?
