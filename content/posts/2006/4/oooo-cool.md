What was [this](http://blogs.msdn.com/klevy/archive/2006/04/05/568738.aspx) all about? So arbitrary!

Can't we read about something **interesting** instead? Here's a list of really good links about dates and time.

* [GMT Explained](http://www.apparent-wind.com/gmt-explained.html)
* [Daylight Saving Explained](http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/)
* [Calendar Studies](http://serendipity.nofadz.com/hermetic/cal_stud.htm) - all kinds of calendars
* [Date and Time Formats on the Web](http://www.hackcraft.net/web/datetime/) (account was suspended, but Google's [cache](http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:hvpNk3_rflYJ:www.hackcraft.net/web/datetime/+%22Date+%26+Time+Formats+on+the+Web%22&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1) works)
