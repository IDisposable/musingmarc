Jason Bock is [right](http://www.jasonbock.net/JB/Default.aspx?blog=entry.d7ee40b71cb14334b8ae8045eca41ad8). For the first time in my blog reading history, I'm dropping a blog. The irony is that I'm dropping Jason's blog. I just don't want to read another rant about how there is no god, or how fundamentalists are stupid, or how wonderful it is to be able to explain everything through the wonders of science.

Don't get me wrong, I love the scientific method and the gains in understanding it enables. I'm just not cocky enough to believe than our (humankind's) cumulative knowlege is every going to be sufficient to fully explain the universe that contains us. What there is outside of what we can understand is open to debate and faith. That is, unless you want to deny it exists simply because you can't apply science to discover it completely.

Your choice :). That's what great about freedom - if someone pisses you off, stop listening to them.  
  
I should be very clear about one of your statements: "I'm just not cocky enough to believe than our (humankind's) cumulative knowlege is every going to be sufficient to fully explain the universe that contains us." That (at the very least) hints that I AM cocky enough to think that. Nothing could be further from the truth; however, I am also not delusional enough to simply put my trust in faith because a group of people told me to, either. Being skeptical is ruthless, but it's the only way to find the truth.

I never intimated you were, sorry that you read that into it. Nor do I assume that you know anything at all about my beliefs, so I'll disgard your "delusional" comment as mere hyperbole.  
  
Say what you believe, believe what you see, and be true to those beliefs, that's all I want from anyone, self-consistency.  
  
Science has always been about trying to prove your own theories incorrect, and accepting what you can't discard as untrue.
