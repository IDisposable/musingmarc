**Good news:** Microsoft recently released some localized versions of the .Net Framework 2.0. These language packs are downloadable from the link below. **Bad news:** Microsoft still doesn't really get it when offering downloads in alternate languages.

### What do I mean?

Click this link [.NET Framework Version 2.0 Language Pack](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=39C8B63B-F64B-4B68-A774-B64ED0C32AE7&displaylang=en). It'll be in English (nice, as that's the specified display language in the URL).

Now click the **Download** button. You'll get a lovely popup (that may or may not be sized to a readable size). That popup says that there _IS NO English language pack_. Funnny, huh?

That they didn't bother to explain that the English localization is built into the primary release of the .Net Framework is _not_ my complaint. That they wasted my time in even offering an English version is also _not_ my complaint.

Here's my complaint, return to the first page, select any other language and click the **Change** button. Now you get a version that offers another download, and that one _will be_ localized to the selected language. **But so will the download screen!**

That's just dumb.

Even worse is that the file you download is _always_ going to be called langpack.exe (not a different filename for each locale). Even worse is that now the Change Language dropdown now has the language names _in the language you picked to download_.

The concept of what file to download (which language pack) is very different than the UI language of the page (which should driven by the browser accept for culture).
