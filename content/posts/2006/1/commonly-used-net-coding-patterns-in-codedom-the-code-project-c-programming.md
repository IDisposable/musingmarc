When doing code generation using CodeDom, you often need to emit things that are easily expressed in C# or other high-level languages. These patterns (like a `using` block, or an `event` subscription) are ideal candidates for a helper-class to regularize the emission. Luckily, [Omer van Kloeten](http://weblogs.asp.net/OKloeten/) has done the work for us, enjoy [Commonly Used .NET Coding Patterns in CodeDom](http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/codedompatterns.asp) found over at [The Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com)
