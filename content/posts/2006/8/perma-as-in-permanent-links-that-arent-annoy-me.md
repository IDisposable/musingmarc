Dear Microsoft Live.com team, Please stop assigning new link value to all the posts when you upgrade the software on Live.com. I really hate having to prune all the duplicates out of my RSS reader. Permalinks are supposed to be permanent, not "valid until further upgrades". Thank you and enjoy your day, Marc
