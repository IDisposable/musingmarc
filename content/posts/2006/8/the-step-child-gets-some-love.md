Looks like Google is finally going to update Blog\*Spot (a.k.a. Blogger in hosted mode).Â  Coming soon:

*   **Dynamic content** (not static pages) so no more republishing.
*   **Access Control** so you control who can read your blog.
*   **Labels** to let you tag the posts (why they couldn't call them tags, like the rest of the world, I don't know).
*   **Easy layout** to let people that don't get CSS or HTML markup do drag-and-drop stying of the blog.
*   **More feed formats** so you can choose the format you want to publish, and the default of Atom 0.3 will change to Atom 1.0.

I'm waiting anxiously to migrate this blog there and start ~tagging~ labelling things.
