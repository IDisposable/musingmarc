Fun rant, but it rings hollow. Sounds like he's worked with a few guys who write obtuse code, and has blamed their platform for it.
  
Or, he's offended that "object" isn't a verb. But seriously, in all that prose, where's the actual argument?

But look at java's librarys not a lot of static functions where they should be, and static functions where they should'nt. most pepole do not put alot of static methods flying around. and you canot create a function-object wraper around a function. or better yet make a sum function in scheme

```scheme
(define (sum x)  
(apply + x))  
  
in common lisp  
  
(defun sum (x)  
(apply #' x))
```
