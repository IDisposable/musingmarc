PHLAT is PHAT! I may finally have to switch from Google Desktop Search to Windows Desktop Search, because PHLAT lets you tag your files just like GMail lets you tag your messages (why Google couldn't figure this out, I don't know). The search/filter strategy is also really cool, letting you "refine" your search while clearly seeing the filters being applied.
