So today I was looking at some code and some advice I read more than a year ago finally clicked. Quick, what does this code mean?

```csharp
Provider provider = Enum.Parse(typeof(Provider), mySettings.ProviderName, true);
```

Back from looking up that overload of `Enum.Parse` yet? So my point is this, you don't know what that `true` means without looking it up. How much more obvious is this code?

```csharp
enum
{
   CaseSensitive = 0
   , IgnoreCase = 1
} MatchCase;
```

The moral of this story is that instead of building methods that take boolean flags, construct them to take enumerations that clearly document the meaning of the flag. This way you don't have to do an API lookup, or _just know_. I first saw this idea about a year ago... if my head wasn't so full of things I had to _just know_ it might have sunk in earlier.

Interesting -- I've never thought about that since I'm so used to intellisense, but still a good idea.
