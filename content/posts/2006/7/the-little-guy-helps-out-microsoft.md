It seems Microsoft is having [trouble paying the (bandwidth) bills](http://news.com.com/Microsoft+to+charge+for+Office+beta/2100-1012_3-6099987.html) and along comes the "little guy" to help them out. I've [previously mentioned](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2006/07/lower-your-bandwidth-costs-using-p2p.html) [Red Swoosh](http://www.redswoosh.net), a BitTorrent-like product that lets you proxy your files automatically so they get downloaded from any peers that currently have the file (or parts). This very similar to BitTorrent; the differences are that the download happens inside your browser, it doesn't require special preperation (as the Red Swoosh site handles the seeding), and requires only a tiny download. In fact, the latest version 2.0 of the [Red Swoosh client](http://download.redswoosh.net/StandaloneInstaller/0/RSInstaller.exe) has [shrunk from 600KB to 72 KB](http://www.blogger.com/)!

So, if you want to download the Office 2007 beta without paying Microsoft $1.50 to cover thier bandwidth costs, just [click me](http://edn.redswoosh.net/http://download.esd.licensetech.com/Microsoft/DMMSO12B/PRO/AKAMAIFILES/OPPLUS-EN.EXE). \[_Via: [Get the Microsoft Office Professional 2007 Beta](http://www.redswoosh.net/blog/?p=46)_\]
