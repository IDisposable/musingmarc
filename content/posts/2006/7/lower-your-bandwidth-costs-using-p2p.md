If you have _largish_ files you want to share, but are concerned with the speed of your upload link or bandwidth costs there are several options:

*   You can post a Torrent file and the consumer can use a Torrent client; I like [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/). The downside is that this requires a client-side program be installed by the user.
*   You can use a CDN proxy; I like the free [Coral Content Distribution Network](http://www.coralcdn.org/). The downside is that it requires port 8080 be open at this time (promises of just-port-80 long pending).
*   You can now use [RedSwoosh](http://www.redswoosh.com/learn_more_overview.php) to proxy the links. This also requires a client-side download, but they serve it up automatically.
