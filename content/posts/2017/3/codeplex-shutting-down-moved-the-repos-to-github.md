The four simple projects I used to have on CodePlex have been migrated to GitHub.

[IFilter Extractor](https://github.com/IDisposable/IFilterExtractor)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A text extracting **COM** component that uses any installed IFilter (Microsoft Indexing) to extract text from files. Information in [old blog posts](/search/label/IFilter).

[Dynamic Reflection Library](https://github.com/IDisposable/Dynamic)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A library for doing lightweight-code-generation in the era before the expression were a thing. Lots of [old blog posts](/search/label/Dynamic) around here about it.

[URI Template and URI Patterns](https://github.com/IDisposable/URITemplate)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The UriTemplate library is a simple set of code to encapsulate the building and parsing of URIs from replacement tokens. Using this couple of classes will make it easy to build RESTful URIs. Information in [old blog posts](/search/label/UriTemplate)

[ASP.Net RSS Toolkit](https://github.com/IDisposable/ASPNetRSSToolkit)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

An ASP.Net component set for publishing and consuming RSS/Atom feeds in .Net 2.0. Includes a datasource component. This was one of the first things Microsoft open-sourced (sadly in an era where that really meant mostly abandoned). I took the sources and floated a CodePlex repository and then promptly abandoned it myself. Some information in [old blog posts](/search/label/RssToolkit).
