So, as in many years past, I once again am celebrating International Zebra Day. If you want ideas about how to celebrate, check [here](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2007/01/best-to-you-and-yours-on-international.html) and [here](http://musingmarc.blogspot.com/2005/01/happy-international-zebra-day.html) for past posts. This year, I have to add that two more countries have signed on... perhaps you can spread the striped love.
